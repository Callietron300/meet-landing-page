## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS

### What I learned

- I used the figma file for font sizes however I found it hasnt helped make a replica deisgn. I think i've had more sucess in guessing rems by eye.

Things I would love help with:

- I struggled adding margins for my hero-text element- I created a margin class to add the margin in
- I cant stop the page from showing the overflow on the right from the offset pictures at the top
- my btn is taking up the full width of the column and I cant workout how to fix this- its only an issue in desktop view
